            "detailedInfo": "The portal, dating back to the year 1649, originally belonged to the extension of the old Hamburg city hall at Trostbrücke and it led to the premises of the Hamburger Bank. The city’s money reserves in the form of silver bars were stored in the vaulted cellar immediately to the left of the small city hall portal - until they were confiscated by the French occupying forces in the winter of 1813/1814. The portal survived the destruction of the city hall during the Great Fire of 1842. Later incorporated into the Old Johanneum on Domplatz, the portal was finally moved to the present museum building.\n\nThe museum’s architect, Fritz Schumacher, conceived an additional special feature: protected behind a glass frame, a so-called standard clock was installed in the now empty arch. A similar very accurate timepiece had been operated at this location even before the museum existed, namely when the Hamburg Observatory was still located at Holstenwall. The observatory featured a time station, which had also been reinstalled in the new museum. In this way, not only the standard clock, visible from the forecourt, was kept running until 1943, but also the tower clock on the museum roof.",

Of the sceptre only the handles have been preserved. When situated at their former location, they embodied a special message: the city’s loyalty as a Free Imperial City lay solely with the German Emperor and not the Danish King, against whom this message was directed.

At that time, some black people did live in the city of Hamburg, as its merchants were active in colonial trade. Children who had been abducted and enslaved worked as household servants here. In a painting by Johannes Voorhout in the museum’s collection, a black boy is depicted as a servant for a music-making social gathering centred around the musician Johann Adam Reincken.

The Spinnhaus and its affiliated church were built with money left by the city councillor Peter Rentzel in his will in 1662.\n\nHe is commemorated by the Latin inscription above the arch: “Ex ultima voluntate et dispositione Dni. Petri Renzelii piae memoriae (According to the last will and testament of Mr Peter Rentzel of blessed memory) … in honorem Dei et flagitiosorum emendationem hoc ergastulum sumptibus ipsius exstructum est (… this workhouse has been built at his expense for the glory of God and the correction of evildoers).” According to the views of the benefactor, constant prayer and work would contribute to the purification of the prisoners. Rentzel thus posthumously erected in his name a further monument to a life pleasing unto God. During his lifetime, he had already generously donated funds for the renovation of Hamburg’s church towers.  \n",

The sandstone entrance portal was five-and-a-half metres high.",

When the museum was built, the portal was installed as the entrance to the garden terrace. The triangular gable is not originally part of the portal. The two columns feature cherubs, masks, and hanging fruit. Grotesque faces are depicted on the arch. The faces and the lion’s head in the centre of the arch may have been intended to function as gatekeepers.\n\nWealth and prosperity were to be protected here, clearly illustrated by the two allegorical figures holding cornucopias and grapes in the spandrels. In the 17th and 18th centuries, members of the nobility even resided in the building. Queen Christina of Sweden and Tsar Peter I were probably the most prominent visitors. Republican-minded citizens of Hamburg tended to tolerate such guests rather than expressing enthusiasm. Yet, it was convenient to have such representative premises in the city centre.",

            "detailedInfo": "The house was located in the southernmost part of what was then Neustädter Fuhlentwiete street, which is now called Düsternstraße. The symbol of the palm branch was fashionable in Hamburg during those decades and its biblical references familiar to most observers. The hope of peace symbolised by the palm branch was clearly appropriate for a time marked by repeated civil unrest.\n\nSchrötteringk also chose the busts of four historic rulers for the facade of his residence. The busts portray, from left to right: the ancient rulers Ninus (with a full beard and a lion’s skin as a cloak), Cyrus the Great (with a turban), Alexander the Great (with long hair and a helmet), and Gaius Julius Caesar (with a laurel wreath). The succession of these rulers could symbolise the succession of historical power structures: The Assyrian Empire was followed by the Persian Empire, then the Macedonian Empire, and finally the Roman Empire. Ideally, this order could even be continued in the early modern period by the German Empire. It is conceivable that Schröteringk used this imagery to advocate stability in his native city, which the German Emperor was supposed to guarantee.",

In the arch spandrels are two allegorical figures with several accessories. The figure on the left is holding eyeglasses and a mirror, while the figure on the right side holds a bird and ears of grain. These could be read as symbolising civic virtues, such as education and wisdom.\n\nEducated contemporaries certainly knew how to translate the Latin saying in the cartouche above to the right: “HOMO / FINEM SUUM” (Man knows not his own end). The sword and scales as attributes of the female figure in the niche above the architrave are only preserved in remnants. This allegory of justice and the inscription “GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO” (Glory to God in the highest) above it were fitting for the work of councillor Dietrich Moller vom Baum.

The two female figures in the spandrels have been preserved. They can be seen as personifications of faith and justice. The figurative decorations of the portal were crafted by the sculptor Georg Baumann. It also includes the statues of the four evangelists.\n\nThe original occasion for the installation of the portal was a festive church service attended by a royal visitor in the autumn of 1603. Christian IV of Denmark was in Hamburg for a promise of loyalty from the city in the form of a tribute. He had just become the father of a potential successor to the throne. The portal arch provided the powerful, but unloved guest a triumphal entrance into the church. Perhaps, however, the imagery of the portal was intended to suggest the sort of Christian virtues that a self-confident city expected from a ruler.",

Also depicted are building types of the day - a palace in the then fashionable Dutch style as well as water and wind mills.\n\nProminent on all three portals are carvings of an empty shield under a sprawling helmet ornament. It is assumed that the Hamburg city coat of arms was displayed here, but was removed as a forbidden symbol of power during the years of the French occupation of the city.
