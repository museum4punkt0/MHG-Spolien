    titleInfo: 'Date: 1649

      Material: Sandstone


      The arch of the small
      city hall portal is not quite three metres high. In comparison to other portals
      around the museum, it seems rather nondescript. The only original elements
      preserved are the two lions in the spandrels and the city coat of arms.

'
    detailedInfo: "The portal, dating back to the year 1649, originally belonged
      to the extension of the old Hamburg city hall at Trostbr\xFCcke and it led
      to the premises of the Hamburger Bank. The city\u2019s money reserves in the
      form of silver bars were stored in the vaulted cellar immediately to the left
      of the small city hall portal - until they were confiscated by the French occupying
      forces in the winter of 1813/1814. The portal survived the destruction of the
      city hall during the Great Fire of 1842. Later incorporated into the Old Johanneum
      on Domplatz, the portal was finally moved to the present museum building.\n\nThe
      museum\u2019s architect, Fritz Schumacher, conceived an additional special
      feature: protected behind a glass frame, a so-called standard clock was installed
      in the now empty arch. A similar very accurate timepiece had been operated
      at this location even before the museum existed, namely when the Hamburg Observatory
      was still located at Holstenwall. The observatory featured a time station,
      which had also been reinstalled in the new museum. In this way, not only the
      standard clock, visible from the forecourt, was kept running until 1943, but
      also the tower clock on the museum roof."

    detailedInfo: "The entrance belonged to an extension built 1601, which was attached
      to the right of the medieval building. Originally, upon entering the portal
      one first walked down a hallway to the council chamber and registry. Only a
      few remnants have been preserved of the portal, which had been renovated many
      times.\n\nOn the city hall portal in the guild hall of the museum, one can
      discover fluted Corinthian columns. Women carrying wreaths and palm branches
      in the arch spandrels symbolise peace. Above them are spear-carrying soldiers
      and lions holding the city coat of arms in a medallion. In the centre, above
      the medallion, the portal is crowned by another female figure serving as an
      allegory of peace. \nAll in all, this pictorial programme could describe the
      state of affairs in Hamburg at the beginning of the 17th century: that of a
      prosperous city that relies on peaceful trade, but which also knows how to
      defend itself against attempted foreign interference. Both hope and advice

      north-west side of the museum are 14 stone figures. They are statues of medieval
      German emperors, which were installed in a very similar way on pedestals on
      the facade of Hamburg\u2019s old city hall at Trostbr\xFCcke until 1842."
    detailedInfo: "Originally, 21 statues had been placed at the facade of the old
      city hall \u2013 seven each on three floors. Almost all of them survived the
      Great Fire, in which the building was not entirely destroyed. At least 20 of
      these statues could be reused in the construction of the new museum building.
      Six of these are lost today, as the building was badly damaged during the air
      raids of the Second World War.\n\nEach of the emperors wear armour and a crown,
      orb, sword or sceptre to signify their power. Of the sceptre only the handles
      have been preserved. When situated at their former location, they embodied
      a special message: the city\u2019s loyalty as a Free Imperial City lay solely
      with the German Emperor and not the Danish King, against whom this message
      was directed. Over time, the emperor figures became a kind of landmark in the
      city, evidenced by the erection of their successors on the new city hall in
      1897."

    detailedInfo: "Both arches feature the depiction of a chubby-faced boy wearing
      a turban-like headdress. At the time of the house\u2019s construction and its
      architectural decoration towards the end of the 17th century, black people
      were often depicted in this manner. Perhaps the immediate proximity of the
      house to St. Catherine\u2019s Church plays a role here, as St. Catherine of
      Alexandria was sometimes worshipped together with St. Maurice, who was usually
      depicted as a turban-wearing black king.\n\nIt is not known, however, if black
      people from Hamburg served as models for the ornamental figures. At that time,
      some black people did live in the city of Hamburg, as its merchants were active
      in colonial trade. Children who had been abducted and enslaved worked as household
      servants here. In a painting by Johannes Voorhout in the museum\u2019s collection,
      a black boy is depicted as a servant for a music-making social gathering centred
      around the musician Johann Adam Reincken. Reincken was the organist at St.
      Catherine\u2019s Church and lived nearby."

      portal from the old Hamburg Spinnhaus prison is now incorporated into the west
      facade of the museum. Until its destruction in the Great Fire of 1842, the
      Spinnhaus was located at what is currently the corner of Alstertor and Ferdinandstra\xDFe,
      i.e. somewhat to the left of the present-day Thalia Theatre."
    detailedInfo: "Together with the neighbouring workhouse and penitentiary, the
      Spinnhaus was one of Hamburg\u2019s premodern prison buildings. It was built
      between 1666 and 1674. As its name implies, the inmates mainly had to spin
      wool. Its prisoners were mainly prostitutes, who were to be resocialised through
      work. The Spinnhaus and its affiliated church were built with money left by
      the city councillor Peter Rentzel in his will in 1662.\n\nHe is commemorated
      by the Latin inscription above the arch: \u201CEx ultima voluntate et dispositione
      Dni. Petri Renzelii piae memoriae (According to the last will and testament
      of Mr Peter Rentzel of blessed memory) \u2026 in honorem Dei et flagitiosorum
      emendationem hoc ergastulum sumptibus ipsius exstructum est (\u2026 this workhouse
      has been built at his expense for the glory of God and the correction of evildoers).\u201D
      According to the views of the benefactor, constant prayer and work would contribute
      to the purification of the prisoners. Rentzel thus posthumously erected in
      his name a further monument to a life pleasing unto God. During his lifetime,
      he had already generously donated funds for the renovation of Hamburg\u2019s
      church towers.  \n"

      Between 1616 and
      1618, the lawyer Vincent Moller vom Baum purchased three plots of land on Speersort
      street in order to build a residential building with several storeys and a
      wide brick facade. The sandstone entrance portal was five-and-a-half metres
      high.'
    detailedInfo: "The portal came into the museum\u2019s possession in 1910, when
      the former apartment building located on Speersort 14 had to be demolished
      in order to widen the street. When the museum was built, the portal was installed
      as the entrance to the garden terrace. The triangular gable is not originally
      part of the portal. The two columns feature cherubs, masks, and hanging fruit.
      Grotesque faces are depicted on the arch. The faces and the lion\u2019s head
      in the centre of the arch may have been intended to function as gatekeepers.\n\nWealth
      and prosperity were to be protected here, clearly illustrated by the two allegorical
      figures holding cornucopias and grapes in the spandrels. In the 17th and 18th
      centuries, members of the nobility even resided in the building. Queen Christina
      of Sweden and Tsar Peter I were probably the most prominent visitors. Republican-minded
      citizens of Hamburg tended to tolerate such guests rather than expressing enthusiasm.
      Yet, it was convenient to have such representative premises in the city centre."

      nicknamed the Old Palace in Hamburg. It was built in the 1670s by the lawyer
      Joachim Schr\xF6tteringk."
    detailedInfo: "The house was located in the southernmost part of what was then
      Neust\xE4dter Fuhlentwiete street, which is now called D\xFCsternstra\xDFe.
      The symbol of the palm branch was fashionable in Hamburg during those decades
      and its biblical references familiar to most observers. The hope of peace symbolised
      by the palm branch was clearly appropriate for a time marked by repeated civil
      unrest.\n\nSchr\xF6tteringk also chose the busts of four historic rulers for
      the facade of his residence. The busts portray, from left to right: the ancient
      rulers Ninus (with a full beard and a lion\u2019s skin as a cloak), Cyrus the
      Great (with a turban), Alexander the Great (with long hair and a helmet), and
      Gaius Julius Caesar (with a laurel wreath). The succession of these rulers
      could symbolise the succession of historical power structures: The Assyrian
      Empire was followed by the Persian Empire, then the Macedonian Empire, and
      finally the Roman Empire. Ideally, this order could even be continued in the
      early modern period by the German Empire. It is conceivable that Schr\xF6teringk
      used this imagery to advocate stability in his native city, which the German
      Emperor was supposed to guarantee."

      the figure on the right side holds a bird and ears of grain. These could be
      read as symbolising civic virtues, such as education and wisdom.\n\nEducated
      contemporaries certainly knew how to translate the Latin saying in the cartouche
      above to the right: \u201CHOMO / FINEM SUUM\u201D (Man knows not his own end).
      The sword and scales as attributes of the female figure in the niche above
      the architrave are only preserved in remnants. This allegory of justice and
      the inscription \u201CGLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO\u201D (Glory to God in the highest)
      above it were fitting for the work of councillor Dietrich Moller vom Baum.
      He also held the office of jurat, a representative of the congregation, at
      the Church of Saint Peter in Hamburg. There, he was responsible for the administration
      of the church property."

    titleInfo: "Date: 1603\nMaterial: Sandstone\n\nThe former south portal of Saint
      Peter\u2019s Church had been dismantled and removed from its original location
      after the Great Fire. It was later incorporated into the inner courtyard of
      the museum. The portal was lucky to survive at this location as well."
    detailedInfo: 'Evocative photos show the severe destruction caused by bomb attacks
      in 1941, which still had not yet been cleared after the end of the Second World
      War. This resulted in the loss, among other things, of the crest above the
      since reconstructed triangular pediment, which featured the figure of St. Peter
      followed by that of an angel. The two female figures in the spandrels have
      been preserved. They can be seen as personifications of faith and justice.
      The figurative decorations of the portal were crafted by the sculptor Georg
      Baumann. It also includes the statues of the four evangelists.


      The
      original occasion for the installation of the portal was a festive church service
      attended by a royal visitor in the autumn of 1603. Christian IV of Denmark
      was in Hamburg for a promise of loyalty from the city in the form of a tribute.
      He had just become the father of a potential successor to the throne. The portal
      arch provided the powerful, but unloved guest a triumphal entrance into the
      church. Perhaps, however, the imagery of the portal was intended to suggest
      the sort of Christian virtues that a self-confident city expected from a ruler.'

    titleInfo: "Date: 1675\nMaterial: Oak / Sandstone\n\nIn 1675, a building yard
      stood on the site of the present day Deichtorplatz. It consisted of a large
      timber-framed edifice with four wings of different lengths around a large courtyard.
      The yard employed up to 400 craftsmen, who were responsible for public building
      projects and the maintenance of the city\u2019s forification."
    detailedInfo: 'Access to the building yard was provided by three portals made
      of oak wood. Today, these are installed side by side in the elongated guild
      hall within the museum. The arch now standing in the centre was originally
      the entrance to the stable on the north side of the building yard, signified
      by the horses rising in the arch spandrels. The former west or main portal
      (in the guild hall on the left) as well as the south or canal portal (in the
      guild hall on the right) feature similarly designed allegorical female figures
      in the spandrels. They are equipped with the tools used at the time by architects
      and wood craftsmen. Also depicted are building types of the day - a palace
      in the then fashionable Dutch style as well as water and wind mills.


      Prominent
      on all three portals are carvings of an empty shield under a sprawling helmet
      ornament. It is assumed that the Hamburg city coat of arms was displayed here,
      but was removed as a forbidden symbol of power during the years of the French
      occupation of the city. From 1847 onwards, the building yard was gradually
      demolished because it stood in the way of the extension of the Berlin railway
      station, newly built roads, and, ultimately, a new customs shed.'
