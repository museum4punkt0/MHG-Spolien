In comparison to other portals around the museum, it seems rather nondescript. The only original elements preserved are the two lions in the spandrels and the city coat of arms.\n",
        "detailedInfo": "The portal, dating back to the year 1649, originally belonged to the extension of the old Hamburg city hall at Trostbrücke and it led to the premises of the Hamburger Bank. The city’s money reserves in the form of silver bars were stored in the vaulted cellar immediately to the left of the small city hall portal - until they were confiscated by the French occupying forces in the winter of 1813/1814. The portal survived the destruction of the city hall during the Great Fire of 1842. Later incorporated into the Old Johanneum on Domplatz, the portal was finally moved to the present museum building.\n\nThe museum’s architect, Fritz Schumacher, conceived an additional special feature: protected behind a glass frame, a so-called standard clock was installed in the now empty arch. A similar very accurate timepiece had been operated at this location even before the museum existed, namely when the Hamburg Observatory was still located at Holstenwall. The observatory featured a time station, which had also been reinstalled in the new museum. In this way, not only the standard clock, visible from the forecourt, was kept running until 1943, but also the tower clock on the museum roof.",

In the centre, above the medallion, the portal is crowned by another female figure serving as an allegory of peace. \nAll in all, this pictorial programme could describe the state of affairs in Hamburg at the beginning of the 17th century: that of a prosperous city that relies on peaceful trade, but which also knows how to defend itself against attempted foreign interference.

Six of these are lost today, as the building was badly damaged during the air raids of the Second World War.\n\nEach of the emperors wear armour and a crown, orb, sword or sceptre to signify their power. Of the sceptre only the handles have been preserved. When situated at their former location, they embodied a special message: the city’s loyalty as a Free Imperial City lay solely with the German Emperor and not the Danish King, against whom this message was directed.

At the time of the house’s construction and its architectural decoration towards the end of the 17th century, black people were often depicted in this manner.

At that time, some black people did live in the city of Hamburg, as its merchants were active in colonial trade. Children who had been abducted and enslaved worked as household servants here. In a painting by Johannes Voorhout in the museum’s collection, a black boy is depicted as a servant for a music-making social gathering centred around the musician Johann Adam Reincken.

        "detailedInfo": "Together with the neighbouring workhouse and penitentiary, the Spinnhaus was one of Hamburg’s premodern prison buildings. It was built between 1666 and 1674. As its name implies, the inmates mainly had to spin wool. Its prisoners were mainly prostitutes, who were to be resocialised through work. The Spinnhaus and its affiliated church were built with money left by the city councillor Peter Rentzel in his will in 1662.\n\nHe is commemorated by the Latin inscription above the arch: “Ex ultima voluntate et dispositione Dni. Petri Renzelii piae memoriae (According to the last will and testament of Mr Peter Rentzel of blessed memory) … in honorem Dei et flagitiosorum emendationem hoc ergastulum sumptibus ipsius exstructum est (… this workhouse has been built at his expense for the glory of God and the correction of evildoers).” According to the views of the benefactor, constant prayer and work would contribute to the purification of the prisoners. Rentzel thus posthumously erected in his name a further monument to a life pleasing unto God. During his lifetime, he had already generously donated funds for the renovation of Hamburg’s church towers.  \n",

The symbol of the palm branch was fashionable in Hamburg during those decades and its biblical references familiar to most observers. The hope of peace symbolised by the palm branch was clearly appropriate for a time marked by repeated civil unrest.\n\nSchrötteringk also chose the busts of four historic rulers for the facade of his residence. The busts portray, from left to right: the ancient rulers Ninus (with a full beard and a lion’s skin as a cloak), Cyrus the Great (with a turban), Alexander the Great (with long hair and a helmet), and Gaius Julius Caesar (with a laurel wreath). The succession of these rulers could symbolise the succession of historical power structures: The Assyrian Empire was followed by the Persian Empire, then the Macedonian Empire, and finally the Roman Empire. Ideally, this order could even be continued in the early modern period by the German Empire.

In the arch spandrels are two allegorical figures with several accessories. The figure on the left is holding eyeglasses and a mirror, while the figure on the right side holds a bird and ears of grain. These could be read as symbolising civic virtues, such as education and wisdom.\n\nEducated contemporaries certainly knew how to translate the Latin saying in the cartouche above to the right: “HOMO / FINEM SUUM” (Man knows not his own end). The sword and scales as attributes of the female figure in the niche above the architrave are only preserved in remnants. This allegory of justice and the inscription “GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO” (Glory to God in the highest) above it were fitting for the work of councillor Dietrich Moller vom Baum.

The figurative decorations of the portal were crafted by the sculptor Georg Baumann.

Christian IV of Denmark was in Hamburg for a promise of loyalty from the city in the form of a tribute. He had just become the father of a potential successor to the throne. The portal arch provided the powerful, but unloved guest a triumphal entrance into the church.

        "titleInfo": "Date: 1675\nMaterial: Oak / Sandstone\n\nIn 1675, a building yard stood on the site of the present day Deichtorplatz. It consisted of a large timber-framed edifice with four wings of different lengths around a large courtyard. The yard employed up to 400 craftsmen, who were responsible for public building projects and the maintenance of the city’s forification.",
        "detailedInfo": "Access to the building yard was provided by three portals made of oak wood. Today, these are installed side by side in the elongated guild hall within the museum. The arch now standing in the centre was originally the entrance to the stable on the north side of the building yard, signified by the horses rising in the arch spandrels. The former west or main portal (in the guild hall on the left) as well as the south or canal portal (in the guild hall on the right) feature similarly designed allegorical female figures in the spandrels. They are equipped with the tools used at the time by architects and wood craftsmen. Also depicted are building types of the day - a palace in the then fashionable Dutch style as well as water and wind mills.\n\nProminent on all three portals are carvings of an empty shield under a sprawling helmet ornament. It is assumed that the Hamburg city coat of arms was displayed here, but was removed as a forbidden symbol of power during the years of the French occupation of the city. From 1847 onwards, the building yard was gradually demolished because it stood in the way of the extension of the Berlin railway station, newly built roads, and, ultimately, a new customs shed.",
